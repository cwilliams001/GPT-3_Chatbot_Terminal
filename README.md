# OpenAI Chatbot

A simple chatbot using OpenAI's language model API. 

## Getting Started

To use the chatbot, you need to have an API key from OpenAI. Once you have the API key, insert it in line 5 of the code. 

The code implements a simple conversational interface where you can input a question, and the chatbot will respond based on the context of the conversation so far. The conversation context is stored in a dictionary, and is passed as an argument to the `askGPT` function.

## Running the Code

The code can be run in a Python environment. Simply run the `main` function to start the chatbot. The chatbot will greet you and ask how it can assist you. You can then input your questions, and the chatbot will respond. To exit the chatbot, type 'bye'.
